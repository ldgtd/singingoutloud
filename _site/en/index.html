  <p>By purchasing these tracks at the price of your preference, you make a donation to
the Dr. Mukwege’s Panzi Hospital that provides free care and surgery to women
victims of rape, notably in the context of the conflict that has been ongoing in Eastern
Congo for more than twenty years. These donations are transferred to the Hospital
by the <a href="#notabene-1">Singing Out <span class="bold">Loud</span> association *</a>. In addition to the purchase of the tracks, if you
wish to make a more significant donation and keep yourself updated with the

      <p>Where to begin
      that not even our worst nightmares could imagine?
      when no language could ever find a name for such atrocities?
      To talk about a violence
      What words should be used</p>

      <p>They came in the middle of the night
      And violated the entrance of her home
      And so did they with her body
      Forcing her whole family to see
      This monstrosity</p>

      <p>My tears, my prayers
      Go out to you my sisters
      my brothers
      From me to you,
      is it all I can do?</p>

      <p>They destroyed her garden
      and no birth can be given
      All the fruits get rotten
      No life in here anymore
      All that remains is scars and sores</p>

      <p>With a cold-blooded insanity,
      they just ripped her off of her humanity
      It’s the whole community they annihilated
      So imagine how much love
      Imagine how much strength
      will be needed
      to rebuild a present and a future</p>

      <p>Can my words be true
      talking about something I’ve never been through?
      I will never speak from experience,
      who've endured such unspeakable offence:
      May Jah bring my prayers, my love, my strength
      Can my words be true
      While I’m hoping
      To my brothers, my sisters
      To you</p>

  <h1>Project</h1>
  <p><p>The first Singing Out Loud‘s project consists in an information campaign and in a
fundraising for the Panzi Hospital (DRC). The aim is, on the one hand, to speak
about a <span class="bold">conflict that gets but little media attention</span> and that has been devastating
Eastern DRC for more than twenty years – articles written to that end are available
on this website. The first victims of this conflict are the civilians, women in particular
on whom <span class="bold">rape is used as a war weapon.</span>  On the other hand, the aim is, by selling
the song “A Prayer To You”, to raise funds for the Panzi Hospital <span class="bold">of Dr. Denis
Mukwege</span>, Congolese gynaecologist and activist, also known as “the man who
repairs women”.</p>

<p>These conflicts, of which the causes are numerous and complex, are financed and
fed by, among other things, <span class="bold">the mining of precious minerals</span> essential to the
production of mobile phones and other electronic devices. At our modest level,
we can act by supporting financially Dr. Mukwege’s struggle, but above all by
<span class="bold">behaving more as citizens than as consumers</span> by questioning our role, role which
should not be eluded by the <span class="bold">supply chain opacity, the hallmark of neoliberal
globalisation.</span></p>
